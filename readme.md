# Q Learning in Tic Tac Toe

This code file is pretty much a code-with-answer-key session, where I try to recreate something others have done while having their own code to heavily reference. The point of this is to explore Q Learning. The code I structured my game after is [here](https://www.kaggle.com/slobo777/tic-tac-toe-agent-using-q-learning). And [this](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/diving-deeper-into-reinforcement-learning-with-q-learning-c18d0db58efe) is something to learn more about Q learning. 

This repo includes a [Jupyter Notebook](Q Learning Tic Tac Toe.ipynb) and also is itself a script that demonstrates the AI.
